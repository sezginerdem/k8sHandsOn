# AWS-EKS
## AWS Console - Web UI
reproducible
cant review our code
wrote code or commands at least sth scriptable

## AWS CLI
Slightly better than web ui but it is the same problems can be happen

## Terraform
- If you can understand minimum 30 resource in a terraform file for EKS this option can be acceptable but it os complex
- More than 150 line terraform code should be written for a EKS cluster

## EKSCTL
- Initially created by weaveworks, opensoruce, adopted by aws and now official eks cli
-
